                    <h1>DocsInk:</h1>
                    <h3 class="mt-5">Introduction:</h3>
                    <p class="mt-3 text-start">The purpose of this document is to highlight the process and results of a
                        real world implementation of a mobile healthcare communication application, by The Appsbee Team. The
                        document provides virtual guidance on how solutions were provided to every individual requirement,
                        making DocsInk a global product.</p>
                    <h3>Project Requirements</h3>
                    <p>The platform vision of DocsInk was to build an end-to-end cloud based solution that could provide a
                        wide range of value added functionality, such as charge to capture notification, optimal billing,
                        and tele-health delivery services. The design mission was to allow every stakeholder options to
                        communicate seamlessly, save time, and make money- all at an optimal cost. The absence of such
                        solutions was creating significant loss of revenue for healthcare service providers in the hospitals
                        or ambulatory surgical units.</p>
                    <p>Integrated tele-health video component - The application is designed to address the Triple Aim
                        initiative by improving health outcome and patient engagement, increasing patient satisfaction, and
                        reducing otherwise prohibitive costs of Emergency Department, specialty, and urgent care visits,
                        with an integrated tele-health video component. Its Telehealthmodule sets up in seconds with a
                        webcam and microphone that is already available on the laptop.</p>
                    <p>Messaging + Mobile Charge Capture - The charge capture features and functionality are being used by
                        single provider clinics, multi-specialty organizations of several hundred providers, and hospital
                        systems that span counties and network healthcare communities. The charge capture functionality has
                        been built for ease of adoption across any organization or healthcare system.</p>
                    <p>Automated Admission/Discharge/Transfer &amp; Clinical Push Notifications - This module also helps
                        enhancing and carrying forward the provider’s workflow and the patients associated with the service.
                        With continued notification and care coordination, this feature is developed to meet the end
                        demands.</p>
    
                    <p>Rounding &amp; Call Schedule Management - This feature knows the significance of healthcare the best.
                        It meets the needs of every patient around the clock, 24*7*365. Just as healthcare does not stop for
                        a moment, so as this feature. With this attribute, every person can schedule their meeting with any
                        respective doctors or patients over a single platform.</p>
                    <h3>Challenges:</h3>
    
                    <p>The visionary platform required integration of multiple mobile and web technologies. The platform
                        requirements were constantly changing and the Appsbee team had to reach an extra mile in order to
                        meet the time-to-market needs of the customer.</p>
    
                    <p>DocsInk is an app that runs thoroughly on web, iOS and Android platform. The foremost challenge for
                        the developers was to run and implement hybrid code and native code run together as a single
                        application in the mobile devices.</p>
    
                    <h3>Client Experience:</h3>
    
                    <p>The successful timely delivery of the product helped DocsInk to secure several happy and satisfied
                        clients, and the list continues to grow each day. The dedicated and committed efforts of the
                        offshore development team contributed significantly to the successful market launch of this
                        innovative solution. Appsbee also provided flexibility in resource management and made sure that the
                        right talent is available at the right time. DocsInk is on its way to clock $1M revenue within a
                        year of the product launch. Appsbee takes pride in helping its valued client and partner in
                        achieving this feat.</p>
                    <p>“DocsInk has really helped with communication between myself and the outpatient physicians. There are
                        many positives that hospitals bring to the care of patients, but one thing that is a constant focus
                        of quality improvement projects is real time communication between the inpatient care providers and
                        the outpatient care givers. DocsInk goes a long way in helping this process.” Kavin Cannon, MD,
                        Wilm. Health Hospitalist.</p>
                    <p>DocsInk LLC is a North Carolina based startup, envisioned to build a mobile healthcare communication
                        platform. The goal was to bridge the information gap among the doctors, patients, and other value
                        chain players in the medical and healthcare ecosystem. The intended outcome was to help physicians
                        maximize revenue, improve care coordination, eliminate clinical silos, and improve healthcare
                        outcomes of patients. The business idea attracted invested interests and DocsInk has been able to
                        secure $1 Million in Series A funding to date.</p>
                    <h3>What Appsbee did?</h3>
                    <p>Appsbee was a young startup and an emerging leader in the application engineering service provider
                        space. DocsInk outsourced the development of some of its critical modules to Appsbee for its
                        innovative platform.</p>
                    <p>HIPAA Secure Texting - HIPAA compliant secure text messaging platform delivers patient centric text
                        messaging and notifications and instantly connects the practice providers, referral network, and
                        staff in the most efficient communication platform available to healthcare today. Its HIPAA
                        Compliant Text Messaging platform deploys in minutes and connects you to everything.</p>
                    <p>Referral/Consult Management - This feature simplifies and enhances the healthcare provider’s
                        workflow. It allows the user to go through minimal entry procedure, do the submission work, get
                        notified during any time, and also continue the care coordination. This is a single feature, which
                        reduces the work pressure and saves the time length by hour per shift.</p>
    
                    <p>Automated Transition Care Management Dashboard - It helps in providing the care coordination
                        management with a hosted dashboard with real time notifications of the patients. The module meets
                        the needs to transit the patients, from expensive ED utilization back to the PCP, for any disease
                        and acre management by effectively reducing the hospital admission rates.</p>
                    <p>Secure Patient Portal - This secure network of the product serves security to the communication of
                        one and all. This module meets best the importance of keeping each information safe and secure.</p>
                    <p>The platform development started with a prototype of the entire system, which eventually evolved to a
                        larger application. Stakeholder’s real input constantly fed into the system design, to ensure
                        product market fit. However, such development processes required a very robust change management
                        process and great cross border communication- a problem that was evolved by constant communication
                        between Appsbee and DocsInk.</p>
                    <h3>Successful Delivery:</h3>
    
                    <p>From the beginning, the team worked to make the system scalable, from database to the functional
                        level. The development team had to put in good effort to understand and implement the changing
                        requirements and specifications. The team had to cope with the highly dynamic requirements, and put
                        their best foot forward for rapid implementation. The Appsbee R&D; team got involved and worked
                        parallel with the development team in introducing the latest technology and made it successful.
                        Since it was agile development process, the development did not stop for technical challenges.
                        Rather the R&D; team helped them for different technical challenges that the developer faced during
                        the implementation. The Appsbee development team eliminated the time zone barrier to a large extent
                        by making themselves available ensuring 70% time overlap with DocsInk zone.</p>
                    <p>Some of the testimonials of DocsInk from the industry community speak volumes of the value which the
                        DocsInk platform has brought to the industry, and Appsbee is proud of being the successful team
                        behind turning DocsInk from an idea to reality.</p>
                    <p>A lead physician from a major ACO was quoted as saying, "DocsInk is the long awaited solution that
                        cost effectively addresses the issues facing health care today. It’s technology that actually works
                        for physicians, instead of just one more concession that we have to make.”</p>
